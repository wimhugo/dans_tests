              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>The team at SAEON has worked very hard to develop a rigorous approach to repeatable, quantitative assessment of a wide range of Global Change themes on Risk and Vulnerability. This work is summarised in our Semantic Framework, which unambiguously defines concepts such as Exposure, Susceptibility, Impact, Risk, Vulnerability, and Resilience, as well as the relationships between them. </span></div>

              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>SARVA 3.0 makes great strides in empowering officials at local and district municipal level to assess the possible impacts of global change drivers and pressures on their area of interest. Our new Profiling Tool allows any dataset that s available as a standardised service in the web to be included into our profiling framework, and innovative new technology makes comparison and analysis of very large datasets possible.</span></div>

                      <li class="collection-item">Making data available for analysis and exploration, and allowing these datasets to be downloaded with standardised metadata included. This allows planners, service providers, and decision support analysts to include the best available data in their work. The only requirement is to cite data sources properly.</li>
                      <li class="collection-item">Assisting with assessment of Impact Profiles: Our new Impact Profiler is the first in a series of tools developed to assist local and district municipalities with repeatable, ranked assessments of the relative importance of current and future hazards. We believe that planning under conditions of resource constraints will not be properly done without such ranking. The impact assessment tool will be followed in due course by tools for ranking of Vulnerability and Risk.</li>   
                      <li class="collection-item">Linking Mitigation and Adaptation actions and projects to these impacts: We need to link concrete actions to the hazards that we face - short, medium, and long term. To do so, we need to understand what options are available to us, and what has already been done. Too often, mitigation and adaptation options are generalised and not necessarily applicable in the SOuth African context or n a region of interest. SAEON is finalising work on a revamped National Climate Chnage Response Database (NCCRD), which will combione information contrionuted by local authorieties, reneable energy licenses awarded by NERSA, feasible renewable energy options contributed by the BioEnergy Atlas, and funding opportunities from the donor community in an attempt to improve the applicability and precision with which mitigation and adaptation actions are planned.</li>
