              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>The data made available for use in planning and policy support in South Africa come from a large variety of sources, and while the scientific evidence underlying the data is largely sound, the data is not necessarily directly suitable for use in decision-making. There are many reasons for this, but some of them can be addressed systematically - and that is what we have done in preparing data sets for SARVA 3.0. See below for a discussion on each of these improvements.</span></div>

              <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">landscape</i>Scope of Assessment</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>In general, climate models have been used as the point of departure for much of the historical work in Risk and Vulnerability, and the focus has been on medium and longer-term change. Global change has many other pressures and drivers that are of great concern in a developing country - such as demographic shifts, change in economic conditions and the labour market, personal health and well-being, and so on. SAEON is actively working on extending the scope of SARVA to cover most of the elements identified by the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The reason for this is simple: not only are these issues important, but they compete for mitigation and adaptation resources with longer-term/ climate concerns. The only way to objectively assign resources is to evaluate all of these together.</span></div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">language</i>Spatial and Temporal Scale</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Because of limitations in the size of data sets that can be utilised over the web, and because climate models have traditionally been made available at a relative coarse downscaling, the publicly available resources for Risk and Vulnerability have not been detailed enough to apply at district or municipal level. SAEON has addressed this deficiency in two ways: by removing the limitations on dataset size in our web-based toolsets, and by developing data products that utilise fine-scale sources (for example the dwelling frame, or remotely sensed data at 30m resolution). In our current test phase, many datasets are made available at 500m resolution for raster data sets, and at the level of the small area layer dataset/ dwelling frame dataset for vector-based data.</span><br/>
              <p>It is also important to match temporal scale and resolution. SAEON is in process to develop terminology and services that can be used to match timescales properly, and we will be applying this to web-based tools in future to assist end users with matching datasets appropriately in space and time.</p>

              <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">trending_up</i>Distinguishing Stocks and Flows</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>'Stocks' and 'Flows' are two fundamentally different data types, and it is important to take note of what this implies for Risk and Vulnerability assessment. One the one hand, we are interested in historical, current, or future values for the characteristics of Stocks - these are typically the Capital that we wish to protect or improve. Examples are found in the attributes of the population, the natural environment, and the built environment. For all of the Stocks that we are interested in, we need to understand three generic aspects: its exposure, its susceptibility, and its resilience (or lack of it). Clearly, these characteristics are dependent on the hazard being considered.</span><br/>
              <p>
              Pressures and drivers in respect of Global Change, on the other hand, are 'Flows' - the rate of change in one or more characteristics of a Stock. Important aspects of this includes the magnitude, rate, frequency, and probability of these flows. Many short-term hazards are caused by rapid changes in a characteristic (such as flood, fire, seismic events).

              <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">access_time</i>Delayed or Distributed Impact</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>One should also be very aware of the fact that pressures and drivers can impact stocks in a different location (action over a distance), or at some time in the future (action over time). Traditionally, these impacts have not been considered well in Risk and Vulnerability assessments. Examples include UV radiation exposure (leading to an impact at a future time and potentially in a different location) or diseases spread by travellers (vectors act at a different location from its original impact). SAEON is working on ways to allow such assessments to be done more reliably and responsibly than in the past.</span></div>
