              <p>SARVA 3.0 is much more participative than its predecessors. Not only do we allow officials to generate region-specific asssessments of impact, but contributions of data in respect of mitigation and adaptation actions, disasters, and other important or noteworthy global change related events are also possible. We will shortly pilot contributions of media - such as photographs and videos - to be linked to our events datanbase via mobile phones.
              </p><br/>
              <p>SAEON's proposed Events Database will blend data from a variety of sources, including social media monitoring, news site monitoring, contributions of photographs and videos, and remotely sensed data. These data streams can be compared to historical data on declared disasters obtained from NDMC.</p><br/>
              <p>It is hoped that we can use these techniques to generate datasets that are otherwise very diofficult or impossible to obtain. As an example: urban fires are widespread in South Africa, and have huge impacts in terms of livelihoods and lives for the poorest of our population - but reliable data on the location, frequency and duration of these fires does not exist. The fires are often too small and short-lived to be recorded by satellites. We therefore see a major advantage in scraping news feeds and social media for urban fire information.</p><br/>
              <p>Similarly, many other events that are of interest to the Risk and Vulnerability community are poorly recorded. Examples include wildlife poaching, service delivery protests, and municipal service interruptions.</p>
