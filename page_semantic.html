              <p>Risk and Vulnerability can be assessed in terms of the characteristics and interactions between Drivers or Pressures, and Stocks or Capitals. Drivers, or Pressures, result from change in the natural or human environment, and can manifest in the short term (or very short term, as is the case with disasters), medium term, or long term. Pressures result from the change in intensity, frequency or quantity of a driver away from its typical baseline. Stocks, or Capitals, are the things that we value: human lives and livelihoods, infrastructure, economic value, and ecosystem services, to name a few.
              </p><br/>
              <p>Observation underpins the entire conceptual framework, allowing us to perceive changes in Driver functions and resulting Hazards and their frequency as well as corresponding responses or Impacts on Stocks.</p><br/>
              <p>Hazards, or 'Perils', are a function of the interaction between a Stock and a Pressure. Specifically, the same Pressure (say rising flood water) can lead to different Hazards if different Stocks are Exposed. When a Stock is Exposed to a Hazard, only the subset of the Stock that is Susceptible will be Impacted. Impact is generally defined as the fraction of the Stock that is Exposed, times the fraction of the Stock that is Susceptible.</p><br/>
              <p>The frequency and/ or probability of a Hazard occurring, in addition to the Impact, determines Risk. If frequency of a Hazard is high, but the Impact is low, the Risk is low, and vice versa. Likewise, Vulnerability or Coping Capacity determines if the Risk is an issue or not. If Risk is high but Coping Capacity is a maximum, it is far less of a problem than if Coping Capacity is low or non-existent.</p><br/>
              <p>Finally, Mitigation and Adaptation measures can be focused on modification of multiple elements of the framework to preserve or improve the state of Stocks.</p>
