              <p>SAEON has made significant progress in building decision support infrastructure based on distributed data sources in the web, but until recently, the utility of these distributed data sources depended, in part, on the size of the datasets. Making use of large amounts of data that must be transferred in a low bandwidth environment, such as experienced by many government institutions, was just not feasible.
              </p><br/>
              <p>Due to a major innovation in how we source and transfer data for analysis and profiling tools, it is now possible to include web-based resources easily and seamlessly into browser-based applications, irrespective of the size of the data that the analysis is based on. Our new Profiling Tool is the first implementation of this technology.</p><br/>
              <p>Using links to standardised services via the SAEON metadatabase, it is now possible to marshal data from a wide variety of sources - such as those hosted by SAEON, satellite obsevations and archives, third party data sources, and dedicated databases without a deterioration is service quality.</p>
